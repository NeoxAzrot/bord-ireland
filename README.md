> ⚠️ Not totally finished yet

## Prerequisites

### Install the database

At the root you will find the file `exportBlogArtGp08.sql` that you have to import in phpmyadmin.

Then you just have to use a [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) space to run the site on your computer.

### Administration

To connect in administrator part of the site and discover the back office, here are the identifiers:

- Login: **Admin**
- Password: **Admin33!**

## About the project

- Back level everything is functional (search bar, admin panel ALL CRUD, sorting of articles, contact form, login / registration / logout, data protection, ...)
- On the front, the integration is **not 100% finished**

### What we could add

- It lacks a responsive integration
- Rethinking the `index.php` of the admin panel
- Review the front end of the search bar results
- Make a more beautiful frontend for the comments of the articles
- Make the legal notice part prettier, we absolutely do not want to read in these conditions
